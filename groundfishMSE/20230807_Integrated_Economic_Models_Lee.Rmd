### Research Question

Under what conditions does an "Implementation Error" approach work well? ...poorly?   

$$F_{jt}=Ftarget_{jt}(1+\varepsilon_j),  \hspace{4mm} ln(\varepsilon) \sim N(\mu_j, \sigma_j^2)$$
 - When "something" happens that is not in the training data.
 - Multispecies with technical interactions?  With regulatory interactions?

.footnote[
Plenty of other ways to model this: based on catch, could have different error distributions, or no error.
]
<!---
  .footnote[
$$ln\frac{F_{jt}}{Ftarget_{jt}} = ln(\varepsilon_j)$$
  ]--->
]

.pull-right[
### Motivation
1. In the U.S., fishery managers set the *upper bound* on catch.
2. Variations of this approach are quite common `r Cite(myBib, c("Hart2013a","Siddeek2020", "Surma2021"))`.
3. It's a *very easy* phenomenological approach to modeling a very important source of uncertainty  `r Cite(myBib,c("Fulton2011a", "Fenichel2013", "Abbott2013"))`.

## Our Approach

1. Simulate the integrated bio-economic model for 20 years.
2. Estimate the $\mu_j$ and $\sigma^2_{j}$ terms for each stock.
3. Use these estimated parameters to simulate an implementation error model for the same 20 years. 
4. Repeat steps 1-3 and compare the results.

- "Implementation Error" yearly catch plotted against "Economic Model" yearly catch
- 45 degree line in red.
- Paired simulations don't match very well on this or other metrics
- Not too surprising, though -- it's just 1 realization.

### How well does an "Implementation Error" approach work (v2) ?
1. Simulate the economic model for 20 years using a random draw of years.
2. Estimate the $\mu_j$ and $\sigma^2_{j}$ terms for each stock.
3. Use these estimated parameters to simulate an implementation error model .opinion[many times].
4. Repeat steps 1-3.

## The Economic Model
.pull-left[
Every day, every captain $i$ chooses the primary target stock $j$ that gets the highest (expected) profits

$$P[Target_{ij}] =P(Revenue_{ij}, Costs_{ij}, Z_{ij})$$

### Expected Revenues for a target are a function of
- **Bottom Trawl Survey Index** 
- Prices of fish
- Vessel-level
    - Skill at catching a target stock
    - Skill at catching (or avoiding) other species
]

.pull-right[
### Quota Prices are a function of 
- **Quota Remaining**
- Prices of Fish
- Quarter of the Fishing Year

## Integrating the Economic and Biological Models

### Feedback Loops
- Simulated Bottom Trawl Survey informs the expected revenue function
  - Higher Index &rarr; more catch
  - Size of the Effect varies by species
- ACLs from the management model constrain the fishing fleet
  - When an ACL is reached for stock $j$, vessels cannot:
      - retain stock $j$ 
      - target stocks that are jointly caught with $j$
- ACL minus cumulative catch equal Quota Remaining
  - As the amount of quota left decreases, quota prices rise
  - Changes in quota prices change the attractiveness of one target relative to another


---
### Uncomfortable Assumptions
.pull-left[
- We have a model of the *groundfish catch share fishery*
  - Recreational, state-waters, other fleet fishing mortality?
  - Canadian waters fishing mortality?
- We use 2010-2015 data to simulate economic variables (fuel and fish prices) **and** biological variables for the non-modeled stocks.
  - We draw randomly fishing years 2010-2015, OR
  - Use a single year of data (2015) data

# Where are we going?
- Explore different scenarios?
  - A depleted stock (in the model, like GB yellowtail)?
  - A depleted stock (not in the model, like Plaice)?
  - Days-at-Sea management?
  - Climate change affecting recruitment?
- Different performance metrics?
  - Distributions of income across firms
  - Which stock indicators?
- Integrate models of prices

# Where else are we going?
A disaggregated (vessel-level) model in which firms choose which ports to utilize.
  -  Effects on communities
  -  Better predict how fishing activity and landings will redistribute in response to policy or environmental changes.
  -  **LANDING** location choice:
    - Travel distances (-)
    - Expected prices/revenues (+-ish)
    - State dependence: Unobserved contractual relationships, formal or informal, between buyers and sellers
