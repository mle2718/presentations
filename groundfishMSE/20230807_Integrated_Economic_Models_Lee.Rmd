## The Economic Model
.pull-left[
Every day, every captain $i$ chooses the primary target stock $j$ that gets the highest (expected) profits

$$P[Target_{ij}] =P(Revenue_{ij}, Costs_{ij}, Z_{ij})$$
Choice of what to do depends on:
- **Expected Revenues**
- **Quota Prices** 
- Fuel Prices
- A few other things

## Expected Revenues and Quota Prices

.pull-left[
Expected Revenues for a target are a function of
- **Bottom Trawl Survey Index** 
- Prices of fish
- Vessel-level
    - Skill at catching a target stock
    - Skill at catching (or avoiding) other species

Quota Prices are a function of 
- **Quota Remaining**
- Prices of Fish
- Quarter of the Fishing Year

## Integrating the Economic and Biological Models

.pull-left[
Working to integrate the Economic model of targeting into a 5 stock variant of the "Groundfish-MSE" from `r Citet(myBib, c("Mazur2023"))`.  

Built out models for GB Yellowtail Flounder, Pollock, GB cod in addition to the existing GOM cod and GB Haddock.

### Feedback Loops
- Simulated Bottom Trawl Survey informs the expected revenue function
  - Higher Index &rarr; more catch
  - Size of the Effect varies by species
- ACLs from the management model constrain the fishing fleet
  - When an ACL is reached for stock $j$, vessels cannot:
      - retain stock $j$ 
      - target stocks that are jointly caught with $j$
- ACL minus cumulative catch equal Quota Remaining
  - As the amount of quota left decreases, quota prices rise
  - Changes in quota prices change the attractiveness of one target relative to another


---
### Uncomfortable Assumptions
.pull-left[
- We have a model of the *groundfish catch share fishery*
  - Recreational, state-waters, other fleet fishing mortality
  - Canadian waters fishing mortality
- We use 2010-2015 data to simulate economic variables (input and output prices)
  - We draw randomly fishing years 2010-2015, OR
  - Us a single year of data (2015) data
- What do we do for biomass index and catch limits for stocks without a biological model?
  - Same thing that we do for economic variables.

Model 1: An economic model.  

Model 3: No implementation error.  

---
### How well does an "Implementation Error" approach work?
1. Simulate the economic model for 20 years using a random draw of years.
2. Assume that $errors=\frac{F}{F-Advice}$ are log-normally distributed, estimate the mean and variance of that distribution for each of the 5 stocks
3. Feed these estimated parameters into the "Implementation - Error" and simulate the model.
4. Repeat steps 1-3.

- Paired simulations don't match very well on any metric (SSB, Catch, etc)
- Not too surprising, though?

### How well does an "Implementation Error" approach work (v2) ?
1. Simulate the economic model for 20 years using a random draw of years.
2. Assume that $errors=\frac{F}{F-Advice}$ are log-normally distributed, estimate the mean and variance of that distribution for each of the 5 stocks
3. Feed these estimated parameters into the "Implementation - Error" and simulate the model .opinion[many times].
4. Repeat steps 1-3.
