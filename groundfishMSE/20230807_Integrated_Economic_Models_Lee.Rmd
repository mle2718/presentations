Choice of what to do depends on:
- **Expected Revenues**
- **Quota Prices** 
- Fuel Prices
- A few other things

## Expected Revenues and Quota Prices

.pull-left[
Expected Revenues for a target are a function of
- **Bottom Trawl Survey Index** 
- Prices of fish
- Vessel-level
    - Skill at catching a target stock
    - Skill at catching (or avoiding) other species
]

.pull-right[
Quota Prices are a function of 
- **Quota Remaining**
- Prices of Fish
- Quarter of the Fishing Year

# Integrating the Economic and Biological Models
Working to Integrate the Economic model of targeting into a 5 stock variant of the "Groundfish MSE" `r Citet(myBib, c("Mazur2023"))`.  Built out models for GB Yellowtail Flounder, Pollock, GB cod in addition to the existing GOM cod and GB Haddock.

# Integrating the Economic and Biological Models

Feedback Loops
- Simulated trawl survey informs the expected revenue function
- ACLs from the management model constrain the fishing fleet
  - When an ACL is reached for stock $j$, vessels cannot:
      - retain stock $j$ 
      - target stocks that are jointly caught with $j$.  
- ACL minus cumulative catch equal Quota Remaining
  - As the amount of quota left decreases, quota prices rise
  - Changes in quota prices change the attractiveness of one target relative to another

Uncomfortable Assumptions
- We have a model of the groundfish catch share fishery
  - Recreational fishing mortality
  - Canadian waters fishing mortality
- We use 2010-2015 to  simulate economic variables (input and output prices).
  - We draw randomly fishing years 2010-2015
  - We just use 2015 data
- What do we do for catch limits for stocks without a biological model?
  Same thing that we do for economic variables.

# An Experiment

How good (or bad) is a standard "Implementation Error" approach?
