# Background I 

- Fishing vessels catch black sea bass

- Fishing vessels transfer their catch to dealers

--
- Dealers 
    - Sort catch into market categories, 
    - Pay the vessel,
    - Report sales info to NOAA Fisheries,
    - Sell to downstream customers

--

- NEFSC deploys biosamplers 
    - Measure lots of fish
    - Collect otoliths from some fish

--

- Numbers-at-age and numbers-at-length are inputs into stock assessment 
    - Fill "missing" data with neighbors


---
# Research Question and Motivation

## Research Question
Can we use prices to say something interesting about the size of Unclassified Black Sea Bass? 

--
**Yes we can**.

--
## Motivation

- No biosampling of the Unclassified fish from 2020-2023.     

--

- Collecting length and age information is costly.  Should we collect it for all
market catgories?


---
# Background II - Scallops and Prices

Price Depends on Size, scallops `r Cite(myBib, "Ardini2018")` are a nice example $^{1}$:

# Preliminaries I

1. Exploratory data analysis step: Do prices vary by size? 
  - Estimate a hedonic model: the price per pound is a function of the transaction level attributes, like market category, gear, and time of year

---
# Preliminaries II
<!---- Not shown are the effects of factor variables for gear,  state, calendar year, and month.
- Not show are the effects of total landings and total landings$^2$.

# Methods Overview I

- Train a random forest classification model `r Cite(myBib, "Breiman2001")` using transaction-level data $^{2}$
on the four principle classes ($c=$Jumbo, Large, Medium, Small) 

.footnote[[2] GARFO's Catch Accounting and Monitoring System (CAMS): stockarea-gear allocated landings at the vessel-dealer-market category level]

  - **Tune** and **train** with a $k-$fold cross-validation
  - **Validate** on a hold-out sample
  - Finalize (retrain) on the entire dataset

--
  
- **Predict** out of sample on the "Unclassified"

--

- Use the results to construct a new length distribution of the landed black sea bass

---
# Assumptions, Potential Problems, and Some solutions

Assumption 1 -  Out-of-sample prediction is valid
  
  - Unclassified fish are the same as classified fish, we just don't observe their class
  - .gray[Concern: There are some transactions by non-federally permitted vessels]

--

Assumption 2 - Dealers have diverse but persistent tendencies in terms of how they classify fish

  - Example 1: Dealer A's Large is 17-20" while Dealer B's Large is 19-22"
  - Example 2: Dealer C only grades into "Large" or "Small"
  - Dealer ID should go into the model as a factor variable
      - Implications for Tuning and training: do a "group" split and $k-$fold 
      - Modified "target encoding" instead of "one-hot"

--

Assumption 3 -  Fishing vessels have similar tendencies to dealers

  - Fishing vessels do not perform the classification, therefore
  - We should **not** include vessel ID as factor variables

<!---
- If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with true value, this is fine.
      - If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with "imputed" or "assigned" value, they *probably cannot* be included in the model.
      - If these are aggregates of multiple transactions, they *probably cannot* be included, even if the true value reported.

# Machine Learning with Random Forest

- Tune (*mtry*) and train a Random Forest on 80% of our data  (2015-2024)
  - Mean log loss as the criteria function. 
  - Very loosely, $Loss=I(Class) - \hat{P}(Class)$ 
  
- 10-fold cross validation $^{2}$ to find optimal *mtry* hyperparameters
  - Grouped on dealer ID so all of a dealer's observations are in exactly 1 fold
  - Avoid overfitting or over-optimism
  
-  Frequency weight observations : Landed Pounds

.footnote[[2] $k$-fold cross validation: Assign all observations to exactly 1 fold.  Run the Random Forest on all but 1 fold, compute mean log-loss.  Repeat.]

# Model Tuning Results

We use mean log-loss to select optimal *mtry.*

Receiver-Operator Curve for our model. We trained the model on 80%, and then predict on the 20% hold out sample.

Haven't gotten to the "confusion" matrix or weighted predictions yet.

  - Should we collect age and length data for all
market catgories?

- Can we modify the way lengths have been borrowed?
