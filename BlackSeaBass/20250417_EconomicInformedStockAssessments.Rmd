# Research Question and Motivation

## Research Question
Can we use prices to say something interesting about the size of Unclassified Black Sea Bass? (**Yes we can**).

## Motivation

* From 2020 to 2023, 5 to 10% of commercial landings were in the “Unclassified” market category; but no fish in this category were measured. 

* It is costly to collect length and age information.  Is trying to collect this information for all market categories the most efficient use of our resources?


---
# Background
For years, economists have asked the opposite question: how much more do buyers pay for large fish compared to small fish? `r Cite(myBib, "McConnell2000")`

Scallops `r Cite(myBib, "Ardini2018")`are a nice example with clean separation:

## Cod is another example

.pull-right[

]

But the separation is not as clean.

# Methods Overview I 

1. Exploratory data analysis step: Do prices vary by size? 
  - Estimate a hedonic model: the price per pound is a function of the transaction level attributes, like market category, gear, and time of year. 
  - A slightly more sophisticated way of checking that prices vary by market category than the box plots from the previous slide.
  
---
# Methods Overview II 

3.  Train a random forest classification model on the four principle classes (Jumbo, Large, Medium, Small).  
  - **Test** and **train** with a k-fold cross-validation.
  - **Validate** on a hold-out sample.
  - Retrain on the entire dataset.
  
4.  **Predict** out of sample on the "Unclassified".

5.  Using the results of (4) reconstruct a new length distribution of the landed black sea bass.

# Pitfalls

**Predict** out of sample on the "Unclassified."  Is the data generating process
the same for Unclassified as it is for Classified?


Data issues
  - Less QA/QC on the "value" columns (value, sppvalue). 
  - State-level reporting.  There are rows in the dealer data that are state-level reports of sales by non-federal permits to non-federal dealers. 
      - If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with true value, this is fine.
      - If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with "imputed" or "assigned" value, they *probably cannot* be included in the model.
      - If these are aggregates of multiple transactions, they *probably cannot* be included, even if the true value reported.

---
# More Pitfalls

Dealers may have diverse but persistent tendencies in terms of how they classify fish.
  - Example 1: Dealer A's Large is 17-20" while Dealer B's Large is 19-22"
  - Example 2: Dealer C only grades into "Large" or "Small"
  - Dealer id should go into the model as a factor variable. 

Problems: 
  - Need to handle this properly in the $k-$fold cross validation, otherwise the training and validation datasets are not truly independent and the model fit measures are overly optimistic. 
  - Would want to include a dealer "fixed effect" as to account the dealer's tendencies.  If all observations of cluster $c$ are in fold $k$, then I don't know how you use that info to predict.
  - Inclusion of factor variables with many levels in a machine learning model can lead to overfitting. "Target" encode instead of "one-hot" (classical expansion of factor into a set of 0/1 dummy variables).

# Hedonic Results
<!---- Not shown are the effects of factor variables for gear,  state, calendar year, and month.
- Not show are the effects of total landings and total landings$^2$.

## Machine Learning with Random Forest

- Tune (mtry) and train a Random Forest on 80% of my data from 2015-2024.  I used 20% as a hold out sample. 

- 10-fold cross validation to find optimal mtry
  - Grouped on dealer id so each dealer is in exactly 1 fold
  - Avoid overfitting or over-optimism
  
- Predictors:
   - Factors: Gear (5), Stock (2), State (9), Year (10), Month (12), Semester (2), Live (2)  
   - Continuous: Price, trip landings, trip landings by market cat, state landings by market cat, stock area landings by market cat, moving average of landings by market category
   - Frequency Weights: Landed Pounds
   - Dealer specific effects: "modified target encoding" (dealer share of previous purchases by market category)

We use mean log-loss to select optimal *mtry.*

#  Predictions

Haven't written the code yet. I can get the 'class predictions' for the "transactions", but
I haven't figured out how to get the weights out.
