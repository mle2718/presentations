# Research Question and Motivation

## Research Question
Can we use prices to say something interesting about the size of Unclassified Black Sea Bass? 

--
**Yes we can**.

--
## Motivation

- From 2020 to 2023, 5 to 10% of commercial landings were in the “Unclassified” market category; but no fish in this category were measured by port biosamplers. 

--

- Collecting length and age information is costly.  Is trying to collect this information for all market categories the most efficient use of our resources?


---
# Background I - A Stylized Model

- Fishing vessels catch black sea bass

- Fishing vessels transfer their catch to dealers

--
- Dealers sort catch, sell to downstream customers, and pay the vessel

--

- NEFSC deploys biosamplers to measure lengths and collect otoliths of fish
    - Measure lots of fish
    - Age some fish

--

- Numbers-at-age or numbers-at-length are inputs into stock assessment 
    - Fill "missing" data with neighbors.

---
# Background II - Scallops and Prices

For years, economists have asked the opposite question: how much more do buyers pay for large fish compared to small fish? `r Cite(myBib, "McConnell2000")`

--

Scallops `r Cite(myBib, "Ardini2018")` are a nice example:

# Preliminaries I

1. Exploratory data analysis step: Do prices vary by size? 
  - Estimate a hedonic model: the price per pound is a function of the transaction level attributes, like market category, gear, and time of year

---
# Preliminaries II
<!---- Not shown are the effects of factor variables for gear,  state, calendar year, and month.
- Not show are the effects of total landings and total landings$^2$.

# Methods Overview I

1.  Train a random forest classification model using data on the four principle classes ($c=$Jumbo, Large, Medium, Small) 

  - **Tune** and **train** with a $k-$fold cross-validation
  - **Validate** on a hold-out sample
  - Finalize (retrain) on the entire dataset

--
  
2.  **Predict** out of sample on the "Unclassified"

--

3.  Use the results to construct a new length distribution of the landed black sea bass

---
# Assumptions, Potential Problems, and Some solutions

Assumption 1 -  Out-of-sample prediction is valid
  
  - Unclassified fish are the same as classified fish, we just don't observe their class
  - There are rows in the dealer data that are state-level reports of sales by non-federal permits to non-federal dealers

--

Assumption 2 - Dealers have diverse but persistent tendencies in terms of how they classify fish

  - Example 1: Dealer A's Large is 17-20" while Dealer B's Large is 19-22"
  - Example 2: Dealer C only grades into "Large" or "Small"
  - Dealer ID should go into the model as a factor variable
      - Implications for Tuning and training: do a "group" split and $k-$fold 
      - Modified "target encoding" instead of "one-hot

--

Assumption 3 -  Fishing vessels have similar tendencies, but since they do not perform the classification, we should **not** include vessel ID 
as factor variables

<!---
- If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with true value, this is fine.
      - If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with "imputed" or "assigned" value, they *probably cannot* be included in the model.
      - If these are aggregates of multiple transactions, they *probably cannot* be included, even if the true value reported.
--->

# Machine Learning with Random Forest

- Catch Accounting and Monitoring System (CAMS)
- Each row is a stockarea-gear allocated landings at the vessel-dealer-market category level

--

- Set aside 20% of our data (2015-2024) for validation

- Tune (*mtry*) and train a Random Forest on 80% of our data  

- 10-fold cross validation to find optimal *mtry*
  - Grouped on dealer ID so all of a dealer's observations are in exactly 1 fold
  - Avoid overfitting or over-optimism
  
-  Frequency Weight observations : Landed Pounds

- Collecting length and age information is costly.  Is trying to collect this information for all market categories the most efficient use of our resources?
- Can we modify the way lengths have been borrowed?
- Can we apply these methods to other stocks?  Which stocks?
- If it works well, can port sampling effort be re-deployed away from categories that are hard to get?
