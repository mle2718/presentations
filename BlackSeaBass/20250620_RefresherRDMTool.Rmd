# Staffing Changes

* Scott Steinback retired April 30, 2025.
  * Everyone on the team will pick up a little extra. 
  * We will probably miss some things.

# Funding Changes 

* Scott had secured about 4 years of Cloud Computing funds through the Social Science 
IRA Strategic Initiative:

  * 2024 half of the SFSBSB
  * 2025 Groundfish
  * 2026 SFSBSB and Groundfish
  * 2027 Groundfish
  * 2028 probably half of the SFSBSB and Groundfish

* NMFS recalled unobligated IRA funds on June 10, 2025.  None of those IRA funds will 
be spent on cloud computing.

* Social Sciences Branch is planning to pay for the half of 2024 and all of 2025.

* Not sure what we are going to do for 2026.

# Min-Yang and Rec Fishing II

* Worked with Scott on the Groundfish RDM 1.0 for NEFMC from 2012-2023.

--

* Original RDM: One coast-wide set of size and bag limits for the year.

--

* We would bring a handful of prospective regulations to the NEFMC's RAP.
--

* Year 1 - cod stock status was poor, but the RDM said that regulatory changes needed would be minimal.

--


* Year 3 - cod stock status okay, but RDM advised some restrictions.

# Cloud Computing II

* In the 2024 cycle:
  * Users simulated over 330 policies at the state level
  * $14,600 on Cloud Computing
  * $10,200 on Setup and Optimizing 

* We are contingency planning for "no cloud" 

<!---
* For NE Groundfish in 2024, we spent:
  * $13,000 on Cloud Computing
  * $9,000 on Setup and Optimizing 

* 12 users ran a total of 45 different policies.
