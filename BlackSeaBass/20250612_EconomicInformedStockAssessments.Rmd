# Background I 

- Fishing vessels catch black sea bass

--
- Dealers 
    - Sort catch into market categories
    - Pay the vessel
    - Report weight, value, vessel id, trip identifier to NOAA Fisheries
    - Sell to downstream customers

--

- NEFSC deploys biosamplers 
    - Measure lots of fish
    - Collect otoliths from some fish

--

- Numbers-at-age and numbers-at-length are inputs into stock assessment 
    - Fill "missing" data with neighbors


---
# Research Question and Motivation

## Research Question
Can we use prices to infer the size of Unclassified Black Sea Bass? 

--
**Yes we can**.

--
## Motivation

- No biosampling of the Unclassified fish from 2020-2023.     

--

- Collecting length and age information is costly.  Should we collect it for all
market catgories?

---

# Methods Overview I

- Train a random forest classification model `r Cite(myBib, "Breiman2001")` using transaction-level data.  Predict whether an observation is Jumbo, Large, Medium, or Small.

.footnote[

Data comes from GARFO's Catch Accounting and Monitoring System (CAMS): stockarea-gear allocated landings at the vessel-dealer-market category level

Random Forests are "bootstraps" of classification trees, where a subset of explanatory factors are used in each bootstrap.

Classification trees perform recursive binary splitting.  The dependent variable is repeatedly partitioned into two groups based on a single explanatory variable based on minimizing within group variation.
]

  - **Tune** and **train** with a $k-$fold cross-validation
  - **Validate** on a hold-out sample
  - Finalize (retrain) on the entire dataset

--
  
- **Predict** out of sample on the "Unclassified"

--

- Use the results to construct a new length distribution of the landed black sea bass


---
# Assumptions, Potential Problems, and Some Solutions

Assumption 1 -  Out-of-sample prediction is valid
  
  - Unclassified fish are the same as classified fish, we just don't observe their class
  - Concern: There are some transactions by non-federally permitted vessels

--

Assumption 2 - Dealers have persistent tendencies in terms of how they classify fish

  - Example 1: Dealer A's Large is 17-20" while Dealer B's Large is 19-22"
  - Example 2: Dealer C only grades into "Large" or "Small"
  - Dealer ID should go into the model as a factor variable
      - Modified "target encoding" instead of "one-hot"  `r Cite(myBib, "Strobl2007")`

--

Assumption 3 -  Fishing vessels also have these tendencies 

  - Fishing vessels do not perform the classification, therefore
  - We should **not** include vessel ID as factor variables

<!---
- If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with true value, this is fine.
      - If these are transactions (trip/subtrip) with "imputed" or "assigned" value, they *probably cannot* be included in the model.
      - If these are aggregates of multiple transactions, they *probably cannot* be included, even if the true value reported.

# Machine Learning with Random Forest

- Tune (select *mtry*)  train a Random Forest on 90% of our data  (2015-2024)
  - Brier classification as the criteria function
  - Very loosely, $Brier=I(Class) - \hat{P}(Class)$   Need to fix
  
- 10-fold cross validation to find optimal *mtry* hyperparameter

-  Frequency weight observations : Landed Pounds

.footnote[
mtry: The number of randomly selected predictors that go into the Classification Tree.

k-fold cross validation: Assign all observations to exactly 1 fold.  Run the Random Forest on all but 1 fold, compute Brier classification score.  Repeat.]

Factor Variables:

   - Gear : Trawl, Line, Pot/Trap, Gillnet, Other
   - Stock: North or South
   - State of Landing: North Carolina to Maine
   - Year: 2015-2025 
   - Month
   - Semester
   - Live or Dead

Continuous: 
  - Price
  - Trip landings
  - Trip landings by market cat 
  - Aggregate landings 
      - State landings by market cat on other trips*
      - Stock area landings by market cat on other trips*
      - 7 day moving average landings by market category
  - Dealer specific effects: "modified target encoding" (dealer share of previous purchases by market category)

  - Should we collect age and length data for all
market catgories?

- Can we modify the way lengths have been borrowed?
