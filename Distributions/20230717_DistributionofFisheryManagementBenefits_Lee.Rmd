# Assessing Equity in the Distribution of Fisheries Management Benefits
## Data and Information Availability

- Determine the categories of information required to adequately assess where and to whom the primary benefits of commercial and for-hire fishery management accrue;
- Determine what information currently exists within those categories and what additional information, if any, NOAA Fisheries would need to collect;
- Identify potential obstacles to collecting this additional data; 
- Identify methodologies the agency could use to assess the relative distribution of benefits from federal commercial and for-hire fishery management based on available information.

## Some Questions

- What initiatives, if any, related to new socioeconomic data collection have been undertaken within your region?
- What issues or lessons learned are you (your region) experiencing with the current initiatives?
- Are there socioeconomic data collection efforts have been tried and have failed?
- Are there groups of people that you think are not being considered in current efforts but should be?
- Are there types of socioeconomic data related to equity that the Council is using/relying on in decision making?
- Are there types of data and/or analyses related to equity the Council is requesting?
- Are there differences in data/information needs for initially setting up a permit or allocation system vs monitoring changes in a fishery over time?

##  High-Frequency Data Collections

Typically use datastreams primarily designed for assessing stocks of fish, **not** purpose-built collections for socioeconomic analysis

- Better understand how management and environmental change affect important, socially vulnerable groups
- Examine trends in:
    -  Commercial fishing vessel crew demographics
    -  Participation and practices
    -  Views on fishery management
    -  Job satisfaction
    -  Well-being over time

## Are there socioeconomic data collection efforts have been tried and have failed?


---
## Are there groups of people that you think are not being considered in current efforts but should be?
Very uncertain about this

- Future Generations
    - How will they afford to buy access rights from people who currently hold them?
    - How will groups that typically have poor access to capital markets find financing?
- People and groups that did not qualify
    - No fishing history
    - No documented fishing history
- "Subsistence" Recreational users (underserved community?)
    - Likely lower income
    - Likely minority
    - Less likely to participate in fishery management process
    - Recreational measures sometimes have a "Trophy" (2 small fish, plus 1 very large).  The benefits of this are likely to accrue to affluent anglers.
    - Recreational measures sometimes that differ by mode (for-hire vs other).  This *may* shift benefits to affluent anglers or for-hire operators.  
- People who don't show up to Council meetings
  - Low expected gains `r Cite(myBib, "turner2005meetings")`
  - Can't afford the cost 

---
## Are there types of socioeconomic data related to equity that the Council is using/relying on in decision making?

---
## Are there types of data and/or analyses related to equity the Council is requesting?

---
## Are there differences in data/information needs for initially setting up a permit or allocation system vs monitoring changes in a fishery over time? 

- Although common in US Fisheries, an initial allocation does not *need* to be based on fishing history.
  - Politically expedient `r Cite(myBib, "holzer2015property")` for the federally managed stocks.
  - Has participation and equity implications that 
      - Are long-lasting
      - Reinforced by Council process (See `r Citet(myBib, "turner2005meetings")`)

# Other thoughts

- Framed as "Distribution of Fishery Management Benefits", but what about the costs?
  - What are they?
  - Are they borne equitably?
  - Day-to-Day costs are split between public and private sector 
      - Going to meetings, 
      - Providing fishery management advice,
      - At-sea monitoring of catch,
      - Technology R&D. 
  - "Rare" costs also seem to be split
      - Fishery Disasters,
      - Rebuilding from overfished
- Justification for prohibition on "permit splitting" is less compelling for fisheries managed with a hard ACL.
  - Even less compelling for fisheries that are quota managed.
- Data and Capacity are limiting our ability to do longitudinal studies related to equity.
  -  Strategically add relevant socioeconomic fields to certain existing data collections
  -  Informed by Owner and Crew surveys.
