# Assessing Equity in the Distribution of Fisheries Management Benefits
## Data and Information Availability

- Determine the categories of information required to adequately assess where and to whom the primary benefits of commercial and for-hire fishery management accrue;
- Determine what information currently exists within those categories and what additional information, if any, NOAA Fisheries would need to collect;
- Identify potential obstacles to collecting this additional data; 
- Identify methodologies the agency could use to assess the relative distribution of benefits from federal commercial and for-hire fishery management based on available information.

Not going to include this slide, just for reference.

## Some Questions

- What initiatives, if any, related to new socioeconomic data collection have been undertaken within your region?
- What issues or lessons learned are you (your region) experiencing with the current initiatives?
- Are there socioeconomic data collection efforts have been tried and have failed?
- Are there groups of people that you think are not being considered in current efforts but should be?
- Are there types of socioeconomic data related to equity that the Council is using/relying on in decision making?
- Are there types of data and/or analyses related to equity the Council is requesting?
- Are there differences in data/information needs for initially setting up a permit or allocation system vs monitoring changes in a fishery over time? 

Not going to include this slide, just for reference.

# Data and Information Availability
.pull-left[
What do we have? .opinion[*In my opinion*, not nearly enough.]

.opinion[
*In my opinion*, this is due to  
- Under-investment in our ability to collect and analyse socioeconomic information
- Not well-understood by leadership  
- Not well-understood by people who would use this information
- Not well-communicated by our group

- At Fisheries, there are approximately 15 social scientists and 50 economists.  Economists have the tools to tell a small part of any equity story.

- Population: Communities and groups that are underrepresented in fisheries and fisheries management 
- Collected using a power-sharing data collection approach
    - crew
    - shoreside workers
    - immigrants
    - processing workers
    - small scale producers
    - rural producers
    - women

]


.pull-right[
Used to:
- Understand Equity and environmental Justice for minority groups
  - Gullah Geechee
  - Georgia black fishermen

- Understand the role of women in fisheries

- Understand disaster impacts
  - Deepwater Horizon Oil spill
  - Tsunami responses
  
- Parameterize stock assessment models for Gulf of Mexico Red Grouper

## Are there socioeconomic data collection efforts have been tried and have failed?
.pull-left[
 - Vessel owners had strong, negative reactions to the demographic questions during survey pretesting for 2022. Demographics section was removed 
 
- Social Capital survey 
  - not approved by OMB
  - not championed by Fisheries Leadership

- Higher frequency cost survey (every 3 months)
]

.pull-right[

---
## Are there groups of people that you think are not being considered in current efforts but should be?
- Crew
  - Low-Frequency surveying

- Labor at Shoreside Infrastructure. In the Northeast US, they are frequently: 
  - Undocumented
  - South-American (non-Hispanic)
  - Female
  - Non-English speaking
  - Have fragile labor relations
- Shoreside infrastructure firms

- Consumers

- First Nations (in the Northeast US)

## Are there groups of people that you think are not being considered in current efforts?
- Future Generations
    - How will they afford to buy access rights from people who currently hold them?
    - How will groups that typically have poor access to capital markets find financing?

- People and groups that did not qualify
    - No fishing history
    - No documented fishing history

- "Subsistence" Recreational users (underserved community?)
    - Likely lower income and minority
    - Recreational measures sometimes have a "Trophy" (2 small fish, plus 1 very large).  The benefits of this are likely to accrue to affluent anglers.
    - Recreational measures sometimes that differ by mode (for-hire vs other).  This *may* shift benefits to affluent anglers or for-hire operators.  

- People who don't show up to Council meetings
  - Low expected gains `r Cite(myBib, "turner2005meetings")`
  - Can't afford the cost 

---
## Socioeconomic data related to equity that the Council is using?  Requesting?
- Typical analyses include breakdowns of revenues by:
  - Port
  - Gear
  - Vessel size
  - Analyses of non-qualifying firms
  
- More sophisticated or dissagregated metrics? 
    - Not really
    - We have limited ability to provide this information

- NE council has asked what we are doing on the EEJ front.
  - We have the EEJ strategy.
  - How do we implement? Who implements?

## Common Issues and Obstacles
.pull-left[
Under-resourced 
 - Occasional Crew surveys
 - Occasional Cost surveys
 - Voices project being shuttered
 - Very small staff with qualitative focus
 
Under-Valued
  - Importance of qualitative data not understood by Fisheries leadership
    - what else are you going to ask,their shoe size?
  - Sentiment that nobody is going to use this information anyway.
    - Minimal support from affiliated stakeholders 
    - Decision makers don't know how to use qualitative info
]

.pull-right[
Not trusted 
  - "Destroying Fishermen and their Communities since 1976."
  - This information is going to be used against me 
]

---

## Common Issues and Obstacles
- Government
  - Office of Management and Budget 
      - PRA Process is onerous
      - Incentives for surveys are not permitted
  - Short-term funding to implement a survey does not lay the groundwork for a long-term partnership with fishing communities
  - Data governance

- A big imposition for Respondents
  - Survey Fatigue and Coordination
  - Voluntary data collections
  - Lots of time to take a survey
  - Questions are sensitive
  - Questions are difficult to answer

- Representativeness
    - Language barriers for minority populations
    - Scientific staff not diverse enough  
      - In demographic characteristics `r Cite(myBib, c("ando2023environmental", "kuminoff2023new"))`
      - In training 


---
# Other thoughts

- Framed as "Distribution of Fishery Management Benefits", but what about the costs?
  - Day-to-Day costs are split between public and private sector 
      - Going to meetings, 
      - Providing fishery management advice,
      - At-sea monitoring of catch,
      - Technology R&D. 
  - "Rare" costs also seem to be split
      - Fishery Disasters,
      - Rebuilding from overfished

- Although common in US Fisheries, an initial allocation does not *need* to be based on fishing history.

## A Bit More Detail About the High-Frequency Data Collections 

.pull-left[
- Supports analysis at the level of the  
  - Fishing Vessel, Fishing Firm, Seafood Dealer 
  - Captain\* 
- Can be aggregated or disaggregated in
  - Time
  - Space
    - Communities
    - Communities At-Sea
  - By vessel, firm, or captain attributes
