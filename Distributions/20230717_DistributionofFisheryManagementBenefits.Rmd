# Assessing Equity in the Distribution of Fisheries Management Benefits
## Data and Information Availability

- Determine the categories of information required to adequately assess where and to whom the primary benefits of commercial and for-hire fishery management accrue;
- Determine what information currently exists within those categories and what additional information, if any, NOAA Fisheries would need to collect;
- Identify potential obstacles to collecting this additional data; 
- Identify methodologies the agency could use to assess the relative distribution of benefits from federal commercial and for-hire fishery management based on available information.


---
## Some Questions

- What initiatives, if any, related to new socioeconomic data collection have been undertaken within your region?
- What issues or lessons learned are you (your region) experiencing with the current initiatives?
- Are there socioeconomic data collection efforts have been tried and have failed?
- Are there groups of people that you think are not being considered in current efforts but should be?
- Are there types of socioeconomic data related to equity that the Council is using/relying on in decision making?
- Are there types of data and/or analyses related to equity the Council is requesting?
- Are there differences in data/information needs for initially setting up a permit or allocation system vs monitoring changes in a fishery over time?

##  Ongoing Data Collections
.pull-left[
- Most of the socioeconomic analysis uses datastreams primarily designed for assessing stocks of fish, **not** purpose-built collections for socioeconomic analysis
- Supports analysis at level of the: 
  - Vessel or Dealer 
  - Firm  (collections of vessels)
  - Community 
      - Land based, like Ports, counties, or States
      - At-Sea
  - Individual (Captain)

## Are there socioeconomic data collection efforts have been tried and have failed?


---
## Are there groups of people that you think are not being considered in current efforts but should be?

- Future Generations
    - How will they afford to buy access rights from people who currently hold them?
    - How will groups that typically have poor access to capital markets find financing?
- People and groups that did not qualify
    - No fishing history
    - No documented fishing history
- "Subsistence" Recreational users
    - Likely lower income
    - Likely minority
    - Less likely to participate in fishery management process
    - Recreational measures sometimes have a "Trophy" (2 small fish, plus 1 very large).  The benefits of this are likely to accrue to affluent anglers.
    - Recreational measures sometimes that differ by mode (for-hire vs other).  This *may* shift benefits to affluent anglers or for-hire operators.
